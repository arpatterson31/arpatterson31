## < Hey there, hey! />

I'm Audrey! I'm a Software Developer based in Seattle, WA. I'm experienced in JavaScript, React, React Native, and Node.js. I have over ten years of experience in software training and implementation. I love that technology is constantly changing because it allows me to keep my mind active as I continue to learn new things. I made the jump into software development by learning through free courses and then finally completing a six month coding bootcamp. If I can make a positive impact on the world through the projects I work on or create, then moving into this industry has been worth it.

Aside from software development, I enjoy spending time with my daughter and two chonky kitties. I love creating art, collecting art in the form of tattoos, and geeking out over the hottest celebrity gossip!

👩🏾‍🏫 I’m currently learning:
  - TypeScript
  - iOS & Swift

I love making new connections so please reach out to me on the following social accounts.
